### `Getting Started`

In the project directory, you can run:

##### 1. Create a env file

```sh
yarn cp
```


##### 2. Configure your .env file


##### 3. Install all dependencies for a project

This is most commonly used when you have just checked out code for a project, or when another developer on the project has added a new dependency that you need to pick up.

```sh
yarn install
```


##### 4. Runs the app in the development mode

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```sh
yarn start
```


##### 5. Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.

By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

```sh
yarn test
```


##### 6. Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

```sh
yarn build
```
